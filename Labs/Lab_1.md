Try storing the numbers you use by making a variable for each number, if you don't know how to create a variable, check the slides or ask the student assistents!

####Are you lost? 
SPEAK UP! We will help you I promise. Don't let this drag on and you are not alone! :) 
Programming is crazy hard the first time you learn about it.
 
Why not give this site a try. It's super awesome and very clear. http://www.learnpython.org 

####Are you bored? 
Are you horridly bored? Check out some of the examples in Processing under File > Examples... 
Pick a category (I recommend Topics/Simulate/Flocking) and try changing some of the values to see what happens
