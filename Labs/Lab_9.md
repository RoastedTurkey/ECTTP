##Bouncing Balls
##Exercise 9_0 

Make a class called Paddle which has the following attributes: xPos, yPos, ySpeed, color.  
Add the methods move() and display() to the class.  
Make two objects (one for player 1 on the left side of the screen and one for player 2 on the right side of the screen),    
which can be controlled separately by pressing W or S for player 1 and Up or Down for player 2.  
Make sure the paddles cannot leave the screen and can only move up and down.  

##Exercise 9_1

Add the Ball-class from the previous lab to your project. Make sure there is at least one ball object instantiated during the setup.   

##Exercise 9_2

Create a Score-class which keeps score for the two players (think of which attributes this class will need).  
Create a Score object and make sure that if a ball hits the left side of the screen, Player 2 gets a point, if a ball hits the right side of the screen, Player 1 gets a point.
