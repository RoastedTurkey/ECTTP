##Bouncing Balls
##Exercise 8_0 

Make a class called Ball, and give it the following attributes: xPos, yPos, xSpeed, ySpeed, radius.
Also give the Ball class the following methods: def display(), and def move()
Implement the display-fuction so that it draws a rectangle on screen at position: xPos and yPos with member radius.
Now create an object called myFirstBall in your setup function and call the display function on your object.
You should see a ball on your screen.

hint: if you forgot how to create a class, check the slides

##Exercise 8_1

Now implement the Move function which adds the xSpeed to the xPos and the ySpeed to the yPos of the ball.
Make sure it cannot leave the screen.

hint: to make sure the ball does not leave the screen, you can flip the xSpeed or ySpeed of the ball when it reaches the side of the screen.

##Exercise 8_2

In your setup-function, create a list called myBallsList = [], and add 10 balls to your list.
In your draw-function, call the move function on all of the balls in the list, using a for-loop.
